### Lab

[Colm Nestor's group](https://liu.se/forskning/epigenetisk-kontroll-av-human-t-cellsbiologi), Linköping University (LiU) -- **2024**

### Focus

Using CRISPR-dCas9-TET1 to reactivate hypermethylated *TET2* in T-ALL cells.

### Overview

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematologic malignancy where tumor suppressor genes such as *TET2* are frequently silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, disrupting normal cell regulation and contributing to leukemogenesis. *TET2*, part of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family, plays a crucial role in DNA demethylation, which is essential for gene activation. Reversing this methylation may restore TET2 function, offering a potential therapeutic strategy.

### Methods & Key Findings

Inspired by recent epigenetic editing studies on [*FOXP3*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104471) and [*CLTA*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.025), I applied and optimized these methodologies to target *TET2*. I designed sgRNAs for the *TET2* promoter region, incorporated them into gBlocks, and verified their sequences through Sanger sequencing. The plasmid constructs were validated through restriction digestion and sequencing prior to transfection.

### Transfection Optimization

- **Jurkat & Loucy Cell Transfection**:
Nucleofection was optimized to enhance transfection efficiency in suspension cells.

- **HEK293T Control Experiments**:
Lipofectamine transfection in HEK293T cells was used to confirm plasmid expression efficiency in adherent cells.

- **Assessment of Transfection Efficiency & Gene Reactivation**: 
    - Fluorescence microscopy & flow cytometry assessed transfection success across all cell lines, using TagBFP as a marker. 
    - RT-qPCR analysis confirmed partial FOXP3 reactivation in Jurkat cells, validating CRISPRa-based epigenetic editing. 

**Key Takeaways**

These results highlight the potential of epigenetic reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy in leukemia. Further optimizations are required to improve transfection efficiency and enhance gene reactivation outcomes.
